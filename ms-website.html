                    Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. 
                    It is our companion since eternity.
                     Despite the importance of nature in human life, we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness. 
                     Millions of years ago, when the knowledge of man was not better than an animal. 
                     At that time man used to get all the things needed for life only from nature. 
                     Even today, at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only.
                      Nature is a boon given to us, as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the earth. 
                      It gives us forests which are the lungs of Earth.
